    <h1>CodeRanch Dibs Reservation System</h1>
    <p>
    Every few months, The CodeRanch administrators select candidates
    for Forum Moderator and through the forums open for bidding.
    </p><p>
    Historically, this process has been done via repeated updates
    of a message thread. But that's hard to track in real time, so
    I've developed this app. In addition to its ability to do useful
    work, it's also my sandbox/showcase for the RichFaces Version 4
    JSF extension tag collection and the Neo4j Nosql DBMS.
    </p>
    <h2>User Roles</h2>
    <p>This app, when properly secured, supports 2 types of users.</p>
    <p>The <b>Dibs User</b> interacts with the Dibs Selection screen.
    This is a fairly simple screen with a shuttle control on it. Users
    place Dibs by shuttling forums of interest to the "selected"
    side of the control.
    </p><p>
    The <b>Dibs Administrator</b> has access to additional functions:
    <ul>
    <li>Reports and archiving the database to YAML-format text files.</li>
    <li>Clearing and loading the database from YAML</li>
    <li>Manual selection of a user ID to make Dibs selections for that user.</li>
    </ul>
   For demo purposes, everyone goes straight to the Admin screen.
   This screen is located <a href="admin/main.jsf">Here</a>.
